### WHO SMART guidelines 
The operational and standardized documentation reflected within the digital adaptation kits (DAKs) represents one of the steps within a broader vision of standards-based, machine-readable, adaptive, requirements-based and testable (SMART) guidelines. SMART guidelines aim to maximize health impact through improved fidelity and uptake of recommendations within standards-based digital systems through a systematic process for transforming guideline development, delivery and application. 
Within this vision, DAKs serve as a prerequisite for developing computable, or machine-readable, guidelines, as well as executable reference software and advanced analytics for precision health. The five-step pathway to advance the adoption of best clinical and data practices for TB is presented below.

### L1 Narrative guidelines
Evidence-based guideline recommendations and accompanying implementation and data guidance for TB.

### L2 Operational guidelines
The L2 TB Digital adaptation kit publications and implementations tools can be found here:
