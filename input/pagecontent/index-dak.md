### WHO SMART guidelines 
[SMART Guidelines](https://www.who.int/teams/digital-health-and-innovation/smart-guidelines/) â€” Standards-based, Machine-readable, Adaptive, Requirements-based, and Testable -- are a comprehensive set of reusable digital health components (e.g., interoperability standards, code libraries, algorithms, technical and operational specifications) that preserve fidelity during the transformation of the guidelines into digital solutions for the adaptation, implementation and uptake of the guidelines. The operational and standardized documentation reflected within the digital adaptation kits (DAKs), as the 2nd layer of the SMART guidelines, represents one of the steps within a broader vision. Within this vision, DAKs serve as a prerequisite for developing computable, or machine-readable, guidelines, as well as executable reference software and advanced analytics for precision health. The five-step pathway to advance the adoption of best clinical and data practices for TB is presented below.

### L1 Narrative guidelines
Evidence-based guideline recommendations and accompanying implementation and data guidance for TB.

### L2 Operational guidelines
