A persona is a depiction of a relevant stakeholder, or end user, of the system.
Although the specific roles and demographic profiles of the personas will vary depending on the setting, generic personas are based on WHO core competencies and credentials of different health worker personas.

### Targeted generic personas

In the case of TB, physicians, nurses and clinical officers are the primary personas for the digital client health record and decision-support system. In the health systems surveyed for this DAK, the common combination of service providers was a physician along with a nurse. The key competences of physicians, nurses and clinical officers are defined by WHO in the Table 2 of the DAK.

### Related personas
In addition to the targeted personas detailed in Table 2, there may be value in exploring other cadres and personas within the context of TB services, such as laboratory technicians or community health workers. However, these were not identified as the central personas for the data and decision-support content detailed in this DAK. Additional related personas are listed in the Table 3 of the DAK.
